As many exciting scientific inquiries do, this investigation raises as many questions as it answers.
Work remains to be done, both with this particular computational model of evolution and more broadly.
Most pressingly, it is hoped that continued investigation will shed light on internal structural characteristics that support direct and indirect plasticity.
It would also be worthwhile to attempt to demonstrate a situation in which search with plasticity outperforms search without in terms of the absolute fitness of champion solutions evolved.
More broadly, it would be fruitful to perform similar experiments with a more directly biologically-inspired model or even \textit{in vivo}.
